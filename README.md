# INFO
 In machine learning, **frequentist methods** optimize objective functions using observed data, while **Bayesian methods** use prior knowledge to estimate posterior distributions and quantify uncertainty. The difference in the context of the BNN can be seen in the following figure.

# Topics in Bayesian Methods

1) **Probability Distributions**

   - **Gaussian (Normal) Distribution:** Commonly used to model environmental noise and uncertainty in value functions.
   
   - **Beta Distribution:** A continuous probability distribution defined on the interval [0, 1], frequently employed in Bayesian statistics to represent probabilities, such as the likelihood of success.
   
   - **Dirichlet Distribution:** Serves as a prior distribution for categorical variables in reinforcement learning (RL).
   
   - **Bernoulli Distribution:** Ideal for modeling binary outcomes in RL tasks, such as the success or failure of an action.

2) **Bayesian Methods in Machine Learning**

   - **Bayesian Neural Networks:** A framework that applies Bayesian inference to neural network architectures, allowing for uncertainty quantification in predictions.
